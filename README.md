## Overview
Create an app to generate lat and long for a specific location as defined by name by the user.  The app should also have the ability to look up the weather for that location.  We also would like to incorporate an error detection function.

## Getting Started
The user should only have to open up the app on the internet and enter the name of a location.  Our app will then return lat and long, as well as weather data or inform the user that they have entered invalid information.

## Architecture
- JavaScript, JQuery
- API: Google geocoding and DarkSky
- Heroku
